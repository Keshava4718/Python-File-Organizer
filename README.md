# File Organizer

## Description
A Python script designed to automatically organize files within a specified directory. It categorizes files into folders such as **Photos**, **Documents**, **Videos**, **Audio**, and **Archives**. Documents are further sorted into subfolders based on their type (PDFs, PPTs, Word documents, Excel spreadsheets). This script helps streamline file management and maintain a tidy file system.

## Features
- **Automatic File Categorization:** Sorts files into designated folders based on their extensions.
- **Subfolder Organization for Documents:** Creates subfolders within the Documents folder to categorize files into PDFs, PPTs, Word documents, and Excel spreadsheets.
- **Directory Creation:** Automatically creates required directories if they do not already exist.
- **Easy to Use:** Requires minimal input â€“ just provide the folder path to organize.
